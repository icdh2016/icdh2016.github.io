The deadline for final paper submission is <strong>September 20, 2016.</strong> Camera-ready paper submission instructions are now located at <a href="http://www.ieeeconfpublishing.org/cpir/authorKit.asp?Facility=CPS_Dec&ERoom=ICDH+2016" target="_blank">http://www.ieeeconfpublishing.org/cpir/authorKit.asp?Facility=CPS_Dec&ERoom=ICDH+2016.</a> It would affect the publication in the proceedings if camera-ready paper does not follow the instructions.</font></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 16px"><font face="'times new roman', times, serif">&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>We suggest you limiting your paper length in 6 pages.</strong> The main reason is that selected best papers will be recommended for publication in special issues of Computers and Electrical Engineering (SCI) and International Journal of Computer Theory and Engineering (EI) after the conference. The journal or special issue papers need to be at least 30% different from the papers published in the ICDH 2016 conference proceedings. If your paper is selected to the journals or special issue, you need to extend it to meet the requirement.</font></span></p>
